All textures originally from Faithful 64x - https://github.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack
I used Midnighttigger's 'Midnighttigger's Default Connected Textures' pack to figure out how the ctm files 
lined up for the single fusion image and organizing my files - https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/mt-ct-d
I modified it for Fusion(Connected Textures) - https://github.com/SuperMartijn642/Fusion
